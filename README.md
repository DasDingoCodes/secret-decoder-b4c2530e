# Secret Decoder Application

This is a secure web application that requires a 6-digit passcode to reveal hidden content including a background image, text message, and audio file.

## Security Features

- Passcode is stored as SHA-256 hash only
- Assets (image, audio, text) are base64 encoded
- Assets are only decoded and displayed when correct passcode is entered

## Encoding Assets Script

To generate secure hashes and encoded assets for your application, use the provided Node.js script:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system

### Usage

1. **Prepare your assets:**
   - A 6-digit passcode (e.g., 123456)
   - An image file (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
   - An audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.) 
   - Text content you want to reveal

2. **Run the encoding script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/encode-assets.js <passcode> <image-path> <audio-path> <text-content>
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/encode-assets.js 123456 ./secret-image.jpg ./secret-audio.mp3 "THE ANCIENT WISDOM HAS BEEN UNLOCKED"
   ```

3. **Update your application:**
   - Copy the generated `PASSCODE_HASH` to replace the value in `src/pages/Index.tsx`
   - Copy the `ENCODED_IMAGE` to replace the value in `src/pages/Index.tsx`
   - Copy the `ENCODED_AUDIO` to replace the value in `src/pages/Index.tsx` 
   - Copy the `ENCODED_TEXT` to replace the value in `src/pages/Index.tsx`

4. **Example output:**
   ```

   Encoded Image (first 100 chars): /9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYW...

   Encoded Text: VEhFIEFOQ0lFTlQgV0lTRE9NIEhBUyBCRUVOIFVOTE9DS0VE
   ```

The script will also generate an `encoded-assets.json` file with all the encoded data for backup purposes.
